# Niveau 3 Spotify artist page

All the HTML have been written for you. Your job is to do all the CSS.

**Fork [this repo](https://github.com/stackerine/exercise-css-spotify-artist-page.git) and commit on your own**

Split you CSS between all the files corresponding to the section:

- main.css
- navbar.css
- player.css
- sideNav.css

Colors are already in the CSS.

The final result may look like the following screenshot
